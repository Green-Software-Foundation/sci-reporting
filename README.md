# GSF SCI-Reporting

## Scope

Creating the infrastructure, and processes to store, host, and publicly report SCI scores, and other related reporting requirements within the SCI specification.
This project enables the GSF to achieve its mission by creating tooling for building green software, and ensuring that sustainability is a core priority for software teams.
 - This project does not define the software boundaries of an SCI application – that is contained within the SCI Open Ontology.
 - This project does not mandate the reporting requirements – that is contained within the Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) specification.
